/*
In the children’s game, Duck, Duck, Goose, a group of children sit in a circle.
One of them is elected “it” and that person walks around the outside of the circle.
The person who is “it” pats each child on the head, saying “Duck” each time,
until randomly reaching a child that the “it” person identifies as “Goose.” At this
point there is a mad scramble, as the “Goose” and the “it” person race around the
circle. Whoever returns to the Goose’s former place first gets to remain in the
circle. The loser of this race is the “it” person for the next round of play. The
game continues like this until the children get bored or an adult tells them it’s
snack time. Write software that simulates a game of Duck, Duck, Goose.
